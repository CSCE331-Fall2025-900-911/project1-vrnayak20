        The Saraswath Learning Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving access 
        to education for students in rural areas. 
        During my time volunteering (June 2020 â€“ October 2020), I contributed to the development and 
        design of their main website, helping create a platform that made resources more accessible 
        to underserved communities.

        I plan to take part in local environmental cleanup events and sustainability initiatives.  
        This includes activities like park cleanups, tree planting, and community recycling drives.  
        My goal is to contribute to creating cleaner and healthier spaces for the community while 
        promoting sustainable practices.

      <p>
        I hope to volunteer as a tutor, offering assistance in math, statistics, and introductory 
        computer science topics.  
        These tutoring efforts will focus on helping students from underserved communities gain 
        confidence and improve their academic performance in STEM subjects.
